        <div class="abouthead"><h2><b>Our vision and mission.</b></h2></div><hr>
        The sole vision of Learner's Academy, is not only to make the young perfect in any one of the streams, but also to open and dispose their minds as may best make them capable of any, when they shall apply themselves to it. Learner's Academy, aims to be the school, which truly believes to unsettle the minds of the young and thereafter inflame their intellects. We aim to help each child realize his potential. We wish not to tell, explain, demonstrate but inspire our students.
        We wish to emphasize more on the method of teaching than the content. We are truly the school with motivation and dedication.
        
        The vision of the school "Service before Self" inspires the students to be future leaders, institution builders and renowned scholars. The mission of the school is to imbibe the intellectual, moral and humanistic values amongst the students so that they can achieve their maximum potential as an individual and as a responsible citizen of the nation.
